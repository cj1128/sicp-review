;; Exercise 2.76

;; three strategies:
;;   - generic operations with explicit dispatch
;;   - data-directed style
;;   - message passing style

;; I think both message-passing and data-directed styles are suitable for many-operations stystem and many-data-objects stystem, when adds a data object or an operation, both styles need almost same work to do.
