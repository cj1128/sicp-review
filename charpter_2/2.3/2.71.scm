;; Exercise 2.71
;; Suppose we have a huffman tree for an alphabet of n symbols,
;; and that the relative frequencies of the symbols are 1,2,4,...
;; 2^(n-1).
;; In suck a tree, how many bits are required to encode the most frequency symbol and the least frequency symbol?

;; most frequency symbol: just 1 bit
;; least frequency symbol: n -1 bit
