;; Consider the encoding procedure that we designed in exercise 2.68,
;; what is the order of growth in the number of steps needed to encode a symbol?
;; Consider the relative frequencies of the n symbols are like what described in exercise 2.71
;; Give the order of growth of the number of steps need to encode the most frequent and least frequent symbols in the alphabet



;; the most frequent symbol: O(n)
;; the least frequent symbol: O(n^2)
